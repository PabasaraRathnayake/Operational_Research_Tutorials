## Question 1
Back Savers is a company that produces backpacks primarily for students. They are considering
offering some combination of two different modelsâ€”the Collegiate and the Mini. Both are made
out of the same rip-resistant nylon fabric. Back Savers has a long-term contract with a supplier of
the nylon and receives a 5400 square-foot shipment of the material each week. Each Collegiate
requires 3 square feet while each Mini requires 2 square feet. The sales forecasts indicate that at
most 1000 Collegiates and 1200 Minis can be sold per week. Each Collegiate requires 45 minutes
of labor to produce and generates a unit profit of $32. Each Mini requires 40 minutes of labor and
generates a unit profit of $24. Back Savers has 35 laborers that each provides 40 hours of labor
per week. Management wishes to know what quantity of each type of backpack to produce per
week.
